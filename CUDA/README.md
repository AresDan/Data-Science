## What is this code?
This code shows example of working with CUDA using C++ and NVIDIA CUDA. It illustrates the usage of different asspects of CUDA, like usage of a shared memory, accumulator, privatized bins, and many others.

**example_privatized_bins.cu** has an example of how the CUDA program looks like. However, partial description of each of methods/theory is located in CUDA_info.ipynb.
